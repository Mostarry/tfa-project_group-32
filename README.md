## Description
There are three files included in this repository:

1. README.md file contains info about the group as well as generally descirbes what we have done for the whole project.

2. Top10.ipynb file which shows what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in zip code 10019. For each of the top 10 causes, calculate the total number of incidents in 2020. The output is a serie called "top10" with top 10 causes and keys and corresponding amounts as values. 

3. Parking.ipynb file which analyzes whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in the zip code 10019 than they are across all zip codes. The output is a boolean named "higher_parking_proportion" which return True if it is the cause and return false elsewise.
